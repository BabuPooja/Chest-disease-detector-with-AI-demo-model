# Chest-disease-detector-with-AI-demo-model
Hi all, welcome to my repository. 

Artificial Intelligence(AI) in healthcare is increasing the chances of detecting diseases in no time compared to this fast world. Detecting disease at its early stage is vital to save lives.

I have been amazed at AI technology being so useful to healthcare and tried to create a demo model which can detect the chest diseases like Bacterial Pneumonia, COVID-19, and Viral Pneumonia compared with around 130 healthy people's data. I created this model with the training of around 130 data for each class.

(Please note, in general millions of data will be used for precise understanding.)

How it works?
From the webpage you open, select "Files" in the input section. and upload any demo image to check if the patient has bacterial pneumonia, covid-19 or viral pneumonia. If the patient has no disease, then the output will be Healthy. You can check the output below the input model.
